# OpenDXL Node-RED Docker
[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/opendxl/opendxl-node-red-docker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/opendxl/opendxl-node-red-docker/)

## Overview

This repository contains the files necessary to build a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that consists of the core [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) installation along with a set of standard OpenDXL Node-RED extensions.

The Docker image exposes a volume that can be easily mapped via higher-level Docker interfaces (Kitematic, Docker Cloud, etc.). This supports the ability to persist Node-RED configuration data external to the Docker container, allowing for upgrades of the Docker image without the loss of configuration information.

The Docker image has SSL enabled by default (use ``https://``) and will generate a self-signed certificate if a key-pair is not found on startup.

The default administrator credentials used to login to the console are ``admin/password``. See the [Node-RED security page](https://nodered.org/docs/security#usernamepassword-based-authentication) for information on updating this password.

A pre-built version of this Docker image can be obtained via the [OpenDXL Node-RED Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/opendxl/opendxl-node-red-docker/) registry on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
